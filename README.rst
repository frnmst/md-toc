Markdown Table Of Contents
==========================

Automatically generate a compliant table of contents for a markdown file to 
improve document readability.

Description
-----------

The table of contents generated by this program is designed to work with
several markdown parsers such as the one used by GitHub and GitLab.

When used with the in-place option this script will write the table of 
contents at the first occurrency of a marker. The default marker is ``[](TOC)`` 
which will result as invisible when reading the parsed markdown file.

By default, titles up to three indentation levels (in HTML: ``h1``, ``h2``, 
``h3``) will be included in the table of contents.

As a final remark, it is possible to generate an ordered and an unordered table 
of contents. In both cases, each element of the toc is by default a clickable 
link to a paragraph in the page. It is also possible to generate non-linked 
version of the TOC.

Rules for generating the table of contents are determined by the selected 
markdown parser. md_toc aimes to be as conformant as possible in respect to 
each one of them.

::

    usage: md_toc github [-h] [-u [{-,+,*}] | -o [{.,)}]] [-l [{1,2,3,4,5,6}]]

    Use Commonmark rules to generate an output. If no option is selected, the
    default output will be an unordered list with the respective default values as
    listed below

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -u [{-,+,*}], --unordered-list-marker [{-,+,*}]
                            set the marker and enables unordered list. Defaults to
                            -
      -o [{.,)}], --ordered-list-marker [{.,)}]
                            set the marker and enables ordered lists. Defaults to
                            .
      -l [{1,2,3,4,5,6}], --header-levels [{1,2,3,4,5,6}]
                            set the maximum level of headers to be considered as
                            part of the TOC. Defaults to 3


::

    usage: md_toc redcarpet [-h] [-u [{-,+,*}] | -o [{.}]] [-l [{1,2,3,4,5,6}]]

    Use Redcarpet rules to generate an output. If no option is selected, the
    default output will be an unordered list with the respective default values as
    listed below. Gitlab rules are the same as Redcarpet except that conflicts are
    avoided with duplicate headers.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help            show this help message and exit
      -u [{-,+,*}], --unordered-list-marker [{-,+,*}]
                            set the marker and enables unordered list. Defaults to
                            -
      -o [{.}], --ordered-list-marker [{.}]
                            set the marker and enables ordered lists. Defaults to
                            .
      -l [{1,2,3,4,5,6}], --header-levels [{1,2,3,4,5,6}]
                            set the maximum level of headers to be considered as
