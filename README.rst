Description
-----------

The table of contents (a.k.a: TOC) generated by this program is designed to 
work with several markdown parsers such as the ones used by GitHub and GitLab.

When used with the in-place option this script will write TOC at the first
occurrency of a marker. The default marker is ``[](TOC)``, which will 
result invisible after the markdown file has been translated.

By default titles up to three indentation levels (in HTML: ``h1``, ``h2``, 
``h3``) will be included in the TOC but the user can decide to keep all
possible levels.

md_toc makes it is possible to generate ordered and unordered TOCs.
In both cases each element of the TOC is by default a
link to a paragraph in the web page. It is also possible to generate 
a non-linked version of the TOC. 

If the user wants it, there is the possibility to ignore space indentations
within the TOC.

Rules for generating the TOC are determined by the selected 
markdown parser. md-toc aimes infact to be as conformant as possible in 
respect to each one of them. This was possible by studying the available 
documentations and by reverse engineering the source codes.

API examples
------------

md-toc has a `public API`_. This means for example that you can you easily 
build a TOC within another Python program. The easiest way to build one 
for a markdown file is:


::


    >>> import md_toc
    >>> f = open('foo.md')
    >>> print(f.read(), end='')
    # this
    ## is
    ## a
    ### foo
    #### booo
    ### foo
    ## file

    ## bye

    # bye
    >>> print(md_toc.build_toc('foo.md'), end='')
    - [this](#this)
      - [is](#is)
      - [a](#a)
        - [foo](#foo)
        - [foo](#foo-1)
      - [file](#file)
      - [bye](#bye)
    - [bye](#bye-1)
