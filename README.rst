Markdown Table Of Contents
==========================

Automatically generate a table of contents for a markdown file to improve
document readability.

The table of contents generated by this program is designed to work with
markdown parsers such as the one used by GitHub and GitLab.

When used with the in-place option this script will write the table of 
contents at the first occurrency of a marker. The default marker is ``[](TOC)`` 
which will result as invisible when reading the parsed markdown file.

Titles up to three indentation levels (in HTML: ``h1``, ``h2``, ``h3``) will be 
included in the table of contents.

Supports anchor links for GitHub, GitLab and simple slugify.

As a final remark, it is possible to generate an ordered and an unordered table 
of contents. In both cases, each element of the toc is a clickable link to a 
paragraph in the page.
